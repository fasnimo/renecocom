                    <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site</h1>
                    <p>I am a Software Engineer and a Graphic Designer. My strengths are in creativity and design to create solutions for everyday web applications. I graduated from Flatiron School with learned technologies such as Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and  React Js. As a Graphic Designer, I have also learned Videography and Photography. My past consists of customer service experience in the Hospitality Industry; I learned how to make acquaintances with my guest that would return time after time. Using the background of being in the Hospitality Industry, I used it as a freelance Graphic Designer and checking in on them to see how they like the product and keep in contact for plans. This background carries over into my development mindset, where I develop with a user in mind and create for those who are not technologically savvy.</p>
